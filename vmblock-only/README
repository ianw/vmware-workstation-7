This files in this directory and its subdirectories are the kernel module
for the VMware Blocking File System.  In order to build, make certain the
Makefile is correct and then just type

	make

from this directory.  A copy of the module will be left in

        driver-<kernel version>/vmblock.o

(e.g. driver-up-2.4.20/vmblock.o) for 2.4 series kernels and in

        ../vmblock.o

for 2.6 series kernels.
